\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
According to the American Diabetes Association, about 11.3 percent of Americans, or about 37.3 million people, have diabetes. Of those 37.3 million people, about 28.7 million were actually diagnosed with diabetes, while the remaining 8.6 million were left undiagnosed (\citet{CDC2022Diabetes}). Those left undiagnosed are at risk for even more serious illness if left untreated. Diabetes is a disease where your body does not create enough insulin, or use it properly, in order to get glucose into your cells and use it for energy (\cite{NIH2023Whatis}). Therefore, it is very important that your body has a normal glucose level. In this paper, I will be working to determine the pre-existing factors that can be used in order to predict if a person may have diabetes. Establishing the predictors is very important to me as many of my family members have a long history of suffering from this disease. It is important to better predict this disease to save people from unnecessary suffering. 

Previously, the prediction of diabetes has been studied using machine learning models. Specifically in Sisodia's paper, it focused on the "Prediction of Diabetes using Classification Algorithms", they worked through the topic by producing results using support vector machine, Naive Bayes classifier, and decision tree classifier (\cite{Sisodia2018Prediction}). In this paper, I will be continuing the investigation with a different data set using logistic regression and various other statistical tests..
